# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Approach 1: NOT IN/EXISTSâ€‹
-- WITH user_by_activity AS
--     (
--     SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS user_cnts
--     FROM Friends
--     GROUP BY activity
--     )
-- SELECT activity
-- FROM user_by_activity
-- WHERE user_cnts NOT IN (SELECT MAX(user_cnts) FROM user_by_activity)
-- AND user_cnts NOT IN (SELECT MIN(user_cnts) FROM user_by_activity)

# Approach 2: Using RANK() to Identify the Maximum and Minimum
-- SELECT activity 
-- FROM 
--     (
--     SELECT activity, 
--         RANK () OVER (ORDER BY(COUNT(id))) AS rank_asc,
--         RANK () OVER (ORDER BY(COUNT(id))DESC) AS rank_desc
--     FROM Friends
--     GROUP BY activity
--     )t0
-- WHERE rank_asc != 1 AND rank_desc != 1

# Approach 3: Remove the Matching Records Using LEFT JOIN
